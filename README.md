# 2D Multiplayer Rocket Game

Welcome to the **2D Multiplayer Rocket Game**! [Play it here](https://kunkelalexander.github.io/flying-turtles/). This project is a simple, fast-paced, and hopefully at least a little fun 2-player game where players control rockets, dodge obstacles, and compete to score points by outmaneuvering each other. Built using the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).
